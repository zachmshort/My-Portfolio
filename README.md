# Zachary Short Portfolio

This is a React Vite App. It displays my previous works, current projects, ways to contact me, and information about my life. I installed the react-dom-router package as well and utilized it. I additionally installed the three js and react three fiber packages because I can import 3d models using said libraries. I plan to integrate [3d models](https://zachmshort.github.io/HelloWorldThreeJS/) into the design in the future, but it was not integral to the MVP.
